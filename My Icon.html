            A role model to all, most especially the computer science department under the umbrella of Faculty of Natural science, Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai.
            He is a calm minded individual whom is always seen and heard in a positive way, especially with so much accomplished works to his name and credits, so also, so much 
            accolades, honours and titles to his name and gallery. Indeed, he is a great man with so much ambitions and the zeal to pass his intuition into the upcoming 
            generation of computer scientist.
